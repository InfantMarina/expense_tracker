1. Virtual Environment:
    modification - converted the default python path to venv path
    reason - For easy maintenance and convenient recovery.
2. Modules imported:
    a.DATABASE(mysql):
        server - Mysql
        modification - settings->database.(converting the sqlite3 to mysql)
        reason - sqlite3 is flat file storage. so it can be used only in parent machine. Our project is a 
        real time project so user will from all over the place so we opt for Mysql. It has efficient 
        security. We can indirectly access to the db.
    b. Faker Library - for generating random data.

    To recover this error (OSError: mysql_config not found ubuntu) run (a)
